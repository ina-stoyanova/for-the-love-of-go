scattered GB London

// potential problems
- same town names across the world, even the same country?
- could the app ask if this is the right locatiyon, maybe offer the other options?
- show name, country, temperature, weather... (clouds, wind, sun)
- can the API return in Celcius
- or do I have to convert it myself? --temperature flag






// HOW do we run all subfolder of tests run from the top level go test cmd



// if all is a string, we lose a lot of the "depth" of the data structure & its fields
// string is usually a very ambiguous
// so we want to hang on to structure (Types) as long as we can, and only turn (throw away the structure) at the very end, when we no longer need it

// we may want to limit the spreading of the external API response in our program, so we create our own struct on top of it, and map to it
// adapter to query the external API and return only data we care about




//if I call mapresponse and something is nil or empty, then it should not panic, but return an error & show to user
// what would be the most flexible?
// how would my  users use the error? if I just print it, would the users be able to react in their consumption of the error?
// better to return the error
// put off printing the error as much as possible, don't close off avenues before I absolutely have to (E.g. printing the error, or returning a string)
// printing is usually very presumptuous -> e..g only while I'm dev-ing, I can see most of it

//Panic is unrecoverable, internal
//what happens if the external API is unavailable
//Panic is when I screw up (the program), not the user, please open a GH issue -> use a library
// I decide as the programmer when it is sensible to continue
//explicit vs implicit panic
